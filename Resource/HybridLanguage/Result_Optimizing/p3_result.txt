As we slowly drove down the street on that cold December evening we spotted the porch light.
"This must be the house. | told our "Positive Teens In Action" group. We pulled up in “ront of an
older home with the porch light glowing. We gathered up our song books, walked UP the steps,
and knocked on the door. We heard a faint voice from inside say, “Come on in. The door is
open." We opened the door.

There in a rocking chair sat an elderly woman with ag stifle on her face. "I've been expecting
you." she said weakly. Ruth was one of our Mealgpn pels stops | had arranged; along with
the usual church members who enjoyed carolers. We hahded Ruth the basket of goodies the
teens had assembled earlier that evening. Then ! askedgRuth what carols she would like to hear.
Ruth's face was beaming as she joined in singing each@ong..

As we hugged Ruth good-bye she said to me with tears glistening in Heffyes, “The day you called |
was still in bed. I had just finished praying. | asked God if it would:b@ possible to have some
Christmas Carolers come to my home and sing this year. Thank you for being the answer to my
Christmas prayer." <

我 们 跟 Ruth 拥 抱 说 再 见 时 ， 她 眼睛 里 内 着 泪 光 对 我 说 :“ 你 打 电 话 那天 我 还 躺 在 床上 ， 刚 刚 做 完 祷告 ， 我 问 上 帝 今
年 能 和 否 让 唱 圣 诞 颂歌 的 人 来 我 家 唱 颂歌 。 感 谢 你 使 我 梦想 成 真 。” :

Wow, what an awesome experience to have the opportunity to be the answer to someone's
Christmas prayer.

哇 哦 ， 能 便 别人 的 祷告 得 以 实现 是 多 棒 的 一 次 经 历 呀 。

Bible Text: When you pray, go to your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen.
And your Father, who sees what you do in private, will reward you.

(22) FX: 祈祷 时 要 去 房间 里 ， 关 上 门 ] 向 无 形 的 上 帝 祈祷， 上 帝 看 见 你 在 秘密 祈祷， 就 会 回报 给 你 。
